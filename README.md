# e.spaceX

e.spaceX is a 2D space shooter that was coded from scratch using React framework as a base for the app and HTML5 Canvas API for the game itself.
Game code was bundled with Webpack for the use of npm-modules and es6+ features on the client side. The game was only slightly tested as this was a demo project.
The game should work on newest versions of modern browsers (Chrome, Opera, Firefox, Edge, etc). The game is designed mainly for FullHD resolution but is responsive.
