# e.spaceX

e.spaceX is a 2D space shooter that was coded from scratch using React framework as a base for the app and HTML5 Canvas API for the game itself.
Game code was bundled with Webpack for the use of npm-modules and es6+ features. Functionality was only slightly tested as this was a demo project. Should work on newest versions
of modern browsers. The game is designed mainly for FullHD resolution but it is responsive. The project utilized free space background
and ship graphics and sounds from the web.
