# e.spaceX

[ ![Codeship Status for fpvonly/e.spacex](https://app.codeship.com/projects/3b0ffc80-fc78-0135-ed44-4220c81d5566/status?branch=master)](https://app.codeship.com/projects/279059)

e.spaceX is a 2D space shooter that was coded from scratch using React framework as a base for the app and HTML5 Canvas API for the game itself.
Game code was bundled with Webpack for the use of npm-modules and ES.Next features.

The game is designed for FullHD-resolution and _desktop_ browsers but it is still responsive for adjusting the game area size. The game has touch events enabled for experimental purposes
but as it's a very resource intensive game, its mobile performance will probably be abysmal. However, it was tested using Firefox on two touch devices (Sony Xperia Z1 Compact and ASUS MeMO Pad 7) and it was playable.
UI is not optimized for mobile devices.

The game should work on the newest versions of the modern browsers of major vendors (Chrome, Opera, Firefox, Edge, etc). The project utilized space background
and ship graphics and sounds from the web.
